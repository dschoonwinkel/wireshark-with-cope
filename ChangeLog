    ieee80211: fix "INVALID" label in Endpoints dialog
    
    Problem: the "Apply as filter" option in the Endpoints dialog creates
    the "INVALID==11:22:33:44:55:66" filter for IEEE 802.11 packets.
    
    Since dissect_ieee80211_common initialises the address "whdr->src" and
    "whdr->dst" fields using the "wlan_address_type" type, we have to do the
    same in "wlan_host_get_filter_type". While at it, remove the check for
    AT_ETHER since these will never match.

    Check before setting the length of a protocol item.
    
    Don't assume that 8 + {32-bit unsigned integer} won't overflow.  Use
    tvb_ensure_bytes_exist() to ensure that the data in question is present;
    it also checks for overflows.
    
    Also, set the length after we've succeeded in dissecting the item - if
    we throw an exception, it's because we don't have all the data, so the
    tvb_ensure_bytes_exist() would have failed, but this way we at least get
    to dissect what data we *do* have.

    dns: prevent repeatedly overwriting resolved entries
    
    When a packet contains multiple conflicting names for the same address,
    it would result in modification of the resolved name every time this DNS
    packet is selected. In Qt, this causes a periodic (one second)
    redissection of the current (DNS!) packet which interferes with user
    interaction. To avoid this, only add the address on the first visit.

    MySQL: Bugfix state handling
    
    A "conversation" is created for MySQL to store "conversation data" including
    current state.  The problem is that it's updated every time a packet is dissected
    so depending on how packets are viewed, dissection may change.
    Fix that by only allowing conversation state to be set on first pass and have
    the state cached with each individual pdu, keyed by tvb_raw_offset() (the key
    when you have multiple pdus in a TCP packet).

    Don't cast to a too-large size.
    
    The maximum record length is 255*128 + 127 = 32767; that fits in a
    guint32, which is large enough to support the biggest packet we'd ever
    support without stretching several size values to 64 bits.
    
    It's not a size of an object in memory, so it doesn't have to be a
    size_t, and a size_t could be too large to fit in the record sizes we're
    using.
    
    Just cast to guint32.

    imap: Give correct lineend to get_token_len()
    
    The return value from get_token_len() is the token length, but the
    returned next_token can have a offset more than token length because
    it also skip trailing blanks.  Ensure we always give correct lineend.

    Don't close the pcap_t in get_data_link_types().
    
    1) Its caller closes it, and closing a closed pcap_t can cause Bad
    Things to happen.
    
    2) We're trying to get an error string from it after we're closing it,
    which won't work well, either.
    
    While we're at it, don't use pcap_statustostr() if we don't have it (we
    have it iff we have pcap_create()).

    Rename a data structure to reflect what it represents.
    
    The structure called a pcap_options structure doesn't (only) hold
    options for a packet capture; it holds all information about a
    particular device, pipe, or socket from which we're capturing.  Rename
    it capture_src - and rename all the pointer variables that point to
    something of that type to pcap_src from pcap_opts.

    Fix the calculation of the number of levels in the radix tree.
    
    The algorithm being used calculated the number of levels in a
    1024-leaf-node tree as being 2, but it's 1 - 0 elements means 0 levels,
    1 through 1024 elements means 1 level, 1025 through 1024^2 elements
    means 2 levels, etc..  With a count of 1024, the loop would bump the
    level count from 0 to 1, and divide the element count by 1024, yielding
    1, so the loop would not terminate, and the level count would them go
    from 1 to 2 and the element count would go to 0.
    
    This could cause problems if exactly 1024 packets were seen.
    
    Just use an if chain, similar to the one used when adding elements to
    the tree.
